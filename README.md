# WordStyle
**Background:**\
Word Style's primary purpose is to help rappers become a better freestyler. A freestyler is someone who makes lyrics on the spot. There is no structure or memorization prior to rapping. This application is a tool to help freestylers. Rappers can use the countdown to help build stamina. Different instrumentals will help rappers being able to rap to different melodies. Random words will constantly keep a rapper on his toes trying to come up with lyrics using or rapping about that word. Recording the audio will be able to capture any magic that may come accross during any particular session.
